            Sri Prabhuji is a realized master whose spiritual journey began at an early age in the sacred
            foothills of the Himalayas. After years of intense meditation and tapasya (spiritual austerities),
            he attained self-realization and has since dedicated his life to guiding sincere seekers on the path.

          <p class="text-base mb-4 text-deep-charcoal">
            His teachings blend the ancient wisdom of Siddha Yoga with practical guidance for modern life.
            Sri Prabhuji emphasizes the importance of daily sadhana (spiritual practice), selfless service,
            and inner transformation as the foundation of spiritual growth.

          <p class="text-base mb-6 text-deep-charcoal">
            With profound simplicity and compassion, he has touched thousands of lives globally,
            establishing ashrams and spiritual centers dedicated to the preservation and transmission
            of the Siddha Yoga lineage.

            The Siddha Yoga Tradition represents an ancient lineage of realized masters who have preserved
            and transmitted the sacred knowledge of self-realization through the ages. This unbroken chain
            of wisdom, known as "Parampara," ensures the purity and authenticity of the teachings.
          </p>
          
          <p class="text-base mb-4 text-deep-charcoal">
            The lineage traces its roots to the Himalayan sages who discovered the subtle science of
            consciousness through deep meditation and inner exploration. These realized beings developed
            systematic practices for spiritual awakening that have been refined and adapted through generations
            while maintaining their essential potency.
          </p>
          
          <p class="text-base mb-4 text-deep-charcoal">
            In our tradition, knowledge is not merely intellectual but experiential, transmitted through the
            direct connection between guru and disciple. This living relationship forms the cornerstone of
            authentic spiritual growth, allowing the disciple to receive not only teachings but also the
            transformative energy (shakti) that accelerates their spiritual evolution.
